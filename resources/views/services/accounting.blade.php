                <h5>Accounting and Bookkeeping Policies in Dubai</h5>
                <p class="text-justify mb-3">In Dubai, accounting practices are guided by the UAE Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These principles are maintained and regulated by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Applicable to all UAE government entities and state-owned companies, GAAP ensures standardized accounting practices across various sectors.</p>
                <ul class="list-icon list-icon-check">
                    <li><strong>Record Keeping Policy</strong></li>
                    <p class="text-justify">Under the UAE Federal Law, businesses in Dubai are required to maintain accurate financial records and statements. These records should be kept intact for a minimum of five years. To ensure tax compliance, it is recommended to retain records for ten years. Adhering to this policy not only fulfills legal obligations but also facilitates transparent financial reporting and auditing.</p>
                    <li><strong>Cash Receipts Policy</strong></li>
                    <p class="text-justify">For transactions involving amounts up to AED 1,000, proper evidence supported by a receipt is essential. Receipts should be issued in the name of the business and contain details such as the date of issuance, the signature of the person issuing the receipt, and the recipient's information. Including the amount and nature of the transaction in the receipt is vital for accurate accounting and financial verification.</p>
                    <li><strong>Bank Transactions Policy</strong></li>
                    <p class="text-justify">To ensure the accuracy of financial records and statements, all bank transactions must be supported by corresponding bank statements. These statements should include pertinent information such as the transaction date, the name and address of the business receiving funds, and the amount and nature of the transaction. Maintaining electronic records of bank statements can aid in preparing annual budgets and profit and loss accounts efficiently.</p>
                    <li><strong>VAT Returns Policy</strong></li>
                    <p class="text-justify">In the UAE, Value Added Tax (VAT) was implemented on January 1st, 2018, and applies to all businesses, whether providing services locally or internationally. Businesses meeting the eligibility criteria are required to register for VAT. To ensure compliance with VAT regulations and streamline the process, businesses should adopt a comprehensive VAT Return Policy that aligns with industry best practices.</p>
