                <h5>Types of Business Setup in Dubai</h5>
                <ul class="list-icon list-icon-check">
                    <li><strong>Sole Proprietorship:</strong> A sole proprietorship is the simplest and most common type of business structure in Dubai. It is owned and operated by a single individual who is personally responsible for all debts and liabilities incurred by the business. This setup offers low startup costs and is relatively easy to establish. The owner has full control over business decisions and the business is taxed at the owner's personal tax rate, which may be advantageous in certain cases. However, the sole proprietorship has limited financial resources and faces challenges in raising capital.</li>
                    <li><strong>Partnership:</strong> A partnership is a business structure owned by two or more individuals who share equal responsibility for the company's debts and liabilities. It is relatively easy to set up and taxed at the partners' individual tax rates. While partnerships offer shared ownership and decision-making, they suffer from a lack of separation between the owners and the business, meaning partners are personally liable for the business's obligations. Additionally, partnerships have a limited lifespan, as they dissolve when any one partner leaves or dies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Liability Company (LLC):</strong> An LLC is a popular choice for business setup in Dubai due to the limited liability protection it provides to its owners. The owners, also known as members, are liable only for the amount they have invested in the company and are not personally responsible for the company's debts and liabilities. This setup is relatively easy to establish and can have foreign shareholders. However, forming an LLC might be more expensive than other business structures, and there could be restrictions on who can own it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Company Limited by Guarantee:</strong> This unique type of company does not have shareholders but instead has members who guarantee the company's debts and liabilities if it faces bankruptcy. While it offers members protection from personal liability, they may need to contribute money to cover the company's debts if necessary. This setup may be more affordable to establish compared to other business structures, but raising capital could be challenging. The company also has a limited lifespan as it dissolves when all members leave or pass away.</li>
                    <li><strong>Joint Stock Company:</strong> A joint-stock company is a business structure that has shareholders who own the company and are responsible for its debts and liabilities. Shareholders' liability is limited to the extent of their investment in the company, providing them with some protection. However, they are still liable for the company's obligations. The establishment of a joint-stock company may be more expensive in Dubai compared to other business structures, and there could be restrictions on ownership. Additionally, the company's lifespan is limited, as it dissolves when all shareholders exit the business or pass away.</li>
