The process of trademark registration in Dubai includes filing an application with the Ministry of Economy, conducting a search to ensure that the mark has not already been registered, and then appearing before the Trademark Committee. The Committee will review the trademark application and, if approved, will issue a certificate of registration. This certificate will be valid for ten years and can be renewed for successive periods of ten years.</p>
