                    <h5 class="fw-normal">Q1: What is a trademark, and how does it differ from other forms of intellectual property?</h5>
                    <p>A trademark is a unique symbol, word, phrase, design, or combination thereof that identifies and distinguishes the goods or services of one business from those of others. It is a crucial aspect of intellectual property and differs from patents (for inventions) and copyrights (for creative works) as it primarily focuses on brand identity and recognition.</p>

                    <h5 class="fw-normal">Q2: Why should I register my trademark?</h5>
                    <p>Registering your trademark provides legal protection and exclusive rights to use that mark in connection with your goods or services. It helps prevent others from using a similar mark that could cause confusion among consumers. Trademark registration is vital for safeguarding your brand identity, building consumer trust, and establishing a strong market presence.</p>
